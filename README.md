- 👋 Hi, I’m @Solaal
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, code, Minecraft, Python, Japan, all the things with any connection with building,  and a lot of other things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning japanese, Python, how to not sleep in economical sciences and how to create Minecraft 2D on my calculator during the math class
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something to improve the NumWorks calculator, on a modded server with me, or a HyPixel playmate
- 📫 How to reach me : post messages on GitHub
